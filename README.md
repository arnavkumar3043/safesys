### Description
SafeSys is a smart anti-theft locker system designed to provide students and admins with a more secure solution for storing valuables. Unlike traditional combination locks, SafeSys offers real-time alerts and monitoring, allowing users to stay informed about locker access. Built by Team Geeky Blinders, SafeSys integrates hardware and software to create a seamless and user-friendly experience.

### Inspiration
We were motivated by the common issue of locker thefts on campuses and the lack of effective solutions. Traditional lockers offer limited protection, and thereâ€™s no way to track unauthorized access or suspicious activity. We wanted to engineer a simple, reliable, and innovative solution that provides peace of mind and helps prevent theft.

### How it Solves the Problem
SafeSys tackles the limitations of traditional locker security with a smart anti-theft system. Through a combination of MUX switch-enabled circuits, Arduino automation, and a mobile app, SafeSys alerts users whenever their locker is accessed. Our system enables real-time monitoring, reports suspicious activity to admins, and empowers users to feel confident about the safety of their belongings.
